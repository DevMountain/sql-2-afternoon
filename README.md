# Project Summary

In this project, we'll continue to use <a href="https://postgres.devmountain.com/">postgres.devmountain.com</a> to practice joins, nested queries, updating rows, group by, distinct, and foreign keys.

Any new tables or records that you add into the database will be removed after you refresh the page.

## Practice joins

### Instructions

<details>

<summary> <code> Syntax Hint </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT [Column names] 
FROM [table] [abbv]
JOIN [table2] [abbv2] ON abbv.prop = abbv2.prop WHERE [Conditions];

SELECT a.name, b.name FROM some_table a JOIN another_table b ON a.some_id = b.some_id;
SELECT a.name, b.name FROM some_table a JOIN another_table b ON a.some_id = b.some_id WHERE b.email = 'e@mail.com';
```

</details>

<br />

1. Get all invoices where the `unit_price` on the `invoice_line` is greater than $0.99.
2. Get the `invoice_date`, customer `first_name` and `last_name`, and `total` from all invoices.
3. Get the customer `first_name` and `last_name` and the support rep's `first_name` and `last_name` from all customers. 
    * Support reps are on the employee table.
4. Get the album `title` and the artist `name` from all albums.
5. Get all playlist_track track_ids where the playlist `name` is Music.
6. Get all track `name`s for `playlist_id` 5.
7. Get all track `name`s and the playlist `name` that they're on ( 2 joins ).
8. Get all track `name`s and album `title`s that are the genre `Alternative & Punk` ( 2 joins ).

## Delete Rows

### Summary

Always do a select before a delete to make sure you get back exactly what you want and only what you want to delete! Since we cannot delete anything from the pre-defined tables ( foreign key restraints ), use the following SQL code to create a dummy table:

<details>

<summary> <code> practice_delete TABLE </code> </summary>

```sql
CREATE TABLE practice_delete ( name TEXT, type TEXT, value INTEGER );
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'bronze', 50);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'bronze', 50);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'bronze', 50);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'silver', 100);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'silver', 100);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);

SELECT * FROM practice_delete;
```

</details>

### Instructions

<details>

<summary> <code> Syntax Hint </code> </summary>

```sql
DELETE FROM [table] WHERE [condition]
```

</details>

<br />

1. Copy, paste, and run the SQL code from the summary.
2. Delete all `'bronze'` entries from the table.
3. Delete all `'silver'` entries from the table.
4. Delete all entries whose value is equal to `150`.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> #1 </code> </summary>

```sql
DELETE 
FROM practice_delete 
WHERE type = 'bronze';
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> #2 </code> </summary>

```sql
DELETE 
FROM practice_delete 
WHERE type = 'silver';
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> #3 </code> </summary>

```sql
DELETE 
FROM practice_delete 
WHERE value = 150;
```

</details>

## eCommerce Simulation - No Hints

### Summary

Let's simulate an e-commerce site. We're going to need users, products, and orders.

* users need a name and an email.
* products need a name and a price
* orders need a ref to product.
* All 3 need primary keys.

### Instructions

* Create 3 tables following the criteria in the summary.
* Add some data to fill up each table.
  * At least 3 users, 3 products, 3 orders.
* Run queries against your data.
  * Get all products for the first order.
  * Get all orders.
  * Get the total cost of an order ( sum the price of all products on an order ).
* Add a foreign key reference from orders to users.
* Update the orders table to link a user to each order.
* Run queries against your data.
  * Get all orders for a user.
  * Get how many orders each user has.

### Black Diamond

* Get the total amount on all orders for each user.
